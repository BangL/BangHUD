#BangHUD
(a Payday 2 BLT mod)

This HUD addition lets you keep a focus on your health and armor status, by showing it additionally in the screen center, where your eyes likely are most of the time anyways.

To not actually block your vision, there are several options like transparency and exact positioning. You can also let it fade out by several conditions like "when armor is full", "when armor and health is full", "when in stealth" and so on. The fade out time can also be set, to keep it fancy.

In case of the "Frenzy" skill, you can set if it should show the 30% health as 100%, or if it should hide at 30% already.

Armor regeneration timers can be shown, as well as the invincibility time when armor breaks while using Armorer or Anarchist perk decks.

Swan song and kingpin injector effect mods are included, and their intensity can be set in the options as well.

Should be compatible to pretty much any other HUD mod out there, since it's an extra panel layer and does not replace or depend on vanilla HUD panels.
